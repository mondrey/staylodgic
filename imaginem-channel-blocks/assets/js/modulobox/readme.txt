*** Thank you for purchasing ModuloBox Javascript Plugin! ***

=== TIPS: ===

1) If your assets folders structure is different from dist folder, you need to change "./modulobox.svg" url in "modulobox.min.css" (or ./css/modulobox.css).
For information, the demo in "/modulobox" folder uses a different folders struture.

2) For security reasons, Internet Explorer blocks AJAX requests if you are not running the script on a server.
So, with Internet Explorer media will not load in the lightbox and will display an error message.
You can add your local site in the Trusted Sites in IE to remove security check or simply run on localhost.

3) For security reasons, all browsers prevent the use of the JavaScript HTML5 History API locally.
You must run on a live or local server the script in order to benefit of Histroy (deeplink) functionality.

4) Most of social sharing buttons will not work locally. You must run the script on a server to share a media with ModuloBox.
Appropriate META tags must be placed in the head of your HTML document in order to correctly share an URL.
The demo of ModuloBox includes the right markup to share on any social platform.

5) N.B.:
If you do not use a task runner, you can use the following online tools to minify/compress scripts:
- You can compress JavaScript files thanks to closure compiler (simple mode) for example: http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
- You can compress CSS files thanks to online tools like: https://cssminifier.com/
